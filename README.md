#Customer Transaction $ Account behhaviour Analysis ( Adasi_staging-Bank-Analysis)

### Project Overview 
This project is a practical SQL-based analysis focused on understanding customer transaction behavior, identifying inactive accounts, and estimating customer value.
The goal is to support data-driven decision-making for finance, operations, and marketing teams.

This analysis is based on simulated bank data and includes solving multiple real-world business questions. It demonstrates how to use SQL to extract insights from transactional and user data. The project covers:

1. Transaction Frequency Analysis
	•	Goal: Categorize customers based on how frequently they transact (monthly average).
	•	Frequency Categories:
	•	High Frequency: ≥10 transactions/month
	•	Medium Frequency: 3–9 transactions/month
	•	Low Frequency: ≤2 transactions/month
	•	Metrics Computed:
	•	Average transactions per customer per month
	•	Number of customers per frequency category

2. Account Inactivity Alert
	•	Goal: Identify all savings or investment accounts with no transactions in the last 365 days.
	•	Use case: Helps operations teams flag and re-engage inactive users.
	•	Output Includes:
	•	Plan ID, Owner ID, Account Type, Last Transaction Date, Days of Inactivity

3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation
	•	Goal: Estimate the customer lifetime value using transaction history.
	•	Insights Generated:
	•	Tenure (months since signup)
	•	Total transactions
	•	Estimated annualized CLV
	•	Ranking customers by CLV
